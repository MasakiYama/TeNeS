Usage
***************************

``TeNeS`` needs to create several input files to define models, order of operations, etc. You can create and run the input file directly, but the following script is provided for ease of use:

-  ``tenes_simple.py``: A tool that generates input files for ``tenes`` by using a simple input file which specifies lattice model predefined.

- ``tenes_standard.py`` (from ver. 1.0):  A tool that generates input files for ``tenes`` by using input files for generating the lattice model.
  
The following sections describe how to use each script, and finally how to use ``tenes``.
See the file format for details on the input file of ``tenes``.
